					<h4>In a bind</h4>
					<p>John Wesley Powell was stuck. In search of pitch from Pinyon Pines to caulk what was left of the Colorado River Exploring Expedition boats, Powell now found himself braced halfway up a chimney of rock, thousands of feet above the Colorado River and his men recuperating in the camp below. He couldn’t down-climb without risking a deadly fall to the narrow ledge he had started from, and the chimney began to widen above him. Finding himself unable to go up or down, he went sideways, further into the crevice he was wedged in. Here, he was able to rest enough to keep climbing, topping out to the rare sight of a sky un-confined by canyon walls. </p>
					
					<p>It was at this point that Major Powell realized his mistake. Although he’d brought a barometer with him that had admittedly made “climbing hard,” he had nothing with which to gather the tree sap. “QUOTE ABOUT SLEEVE.” </p>

					<p>Had it only been eight years since he had enlisted in the Union Army? A son of immigrants, Powell was simultaneously driven by his childhood interest in natural history and a nationalistic pride in the country developing before his eyes. Lincoln was a personal hero of his, yet he was reluctant to experience the front and hoped to be assigned as a fortifications engineer. He found himself in a more active post, leading an artillery brigade, when a lead Minnie ball at the battle of Shiloh struck his right arm above the wrist as he raised it to signal the artillery men he commanded. Remembering the destruction later, he wrote “I scarcely noticed until I attempted to mount my horse.” Powell was tossed 20,000 men died that day. It was the bloodiest battle of the Civil War up to that point. </p>

					<h4>Geological Time</h4>
					<p>After making barometric measurements critical to mapping the course of the river, the point of the whole expedition in the first place, Powell noticed a storm rising on the horizon. In the desert, storms were quick, destructive and powered large events called geologists call “mass wasting”. Arid desert soils are don’t soak up rains and the water masses and mobs down the landscape, when it encounters a canyon, the water’s velocity and force overwhelm the upper walls. Boulder studded debris screams down the cliffs, revealing new landscapes in its path. What Powell witnessed on his way down the cliffs was a small incident in the life of a canyon, but a life threatening force of nature to the lives of the nine men who had accompanied him on his self-funded expedition. As he hurried down the cliffs to warn them, Powell knew that two forces shape a canyon, and both depend on the interplay between rock and water. </p>

					<p>At a time where many people believed the earth was thousands of years old, geology attracted people who contemplated and wondered at the staggering amount of time that held the capacity to carve out landscapes, witness the origin and extinction of species and ossify unknown life forms in ancient muds. And the American Southwest was a perfect place to see the scale of geological time splayed out before them. </p>

					<p>Canyons are scars of the battle between the water and the rising Colorado Plateau. The actual rocks that the Colorado slices through are about half as old as the earth itself, the oldest being about 2 billion years old. However, the river Powell likens to a saw slicing through the layers is much younger, about 2 million years old. What makes the Colorado so powerful is the sediment load it carries constantly sandblasts its own channel, grain by grain cutting itself deeper into its bed. The loss of elevation determines how fast that laden water moves. The Colorado cuts through the Colorado Plateau, which simultaneously experiences uplift while the ancient scattered tributaries assembled into the river we now know. As the plateau gradually rose, the eastern side went slightly higher, and year-by-year its waterways gained speed, liquid running off a table that was being tilted.</p>

					<p>The barometric readings Powell took at the top of the cliffs were scientifically critical to determining their elevation relative to sea level, but were meaningful to his crew of mountain men veterans and buckskin ramblers below because it might provide a scanty clue of what to expect.</p>

					<p>Throughout the expedition, the element that plagued the men the most was the unknown. Being the first, meant they would never know what was around the next bend. It could be uninterrupted swift-moving calm waters that could carry them 40 miles in a day, or it could be the clean thin line and distant roar which would be their introduction to a waterfall and sure destruction. The men depended on the fact that they would be able to beach above rapids and “line” the boats down bad rapids. But they knew they couldn’t depend on that through the whole trip. Knowing their elevation and their distance left to travel, they could estimate if they were gradually losing elevation or if they would be left with hundreds of feet to somehow descend in the last stretches. When they had set off, they truly only knew one thing, if disaster struck, there were few chances for escape. </p>

					<p>Later down the river, far away from Cataract Canyon, Powell was in another bind. This one kept him up in the middle of the night with a decision. He was charismatic and decisive, but Powell had trouble as a leader. Powell took his dinners apart from the other men, insisted on taking scientific measurements despite dwindling food stores, and had never quite forgiven Oromel Howland for losing records and maps in a rapid months earlier. All of these things contributed to the bad blood the group faced almost three months into the trip. The barometers were all long busted and the remaining nine men were down to their last few pounds of wormy flour. The crew was camped above what one member recorded in his journal as emphatically the worst rapid they had seen yet, the sight of which compelled three members of the crew, brothers Oramel and Seneca Howland and Andrew Dunn, to decide to chance the cliffs and the desert beyond rather than follow Powell down the river. That night, Powell lay awake with the roar of the next days’ rapids in his head agonizing. At three in the morning, he woke Oramel Howland and tried to convince him to change his mind. The adversity they’d been through: the near drownings, the campfires, the fights, the horrible food, the trust that had withstood all that had somehow evaporated. Oramel refused. Neither side would follow the other into what they thought was sure death.</p>

					<p>With tears streaming down bearded faces, the two factions parted. The three wouldn’t take their part of the rations with them, so one from the boats placed some precious food where they would find it on their way out of the canyon. Powell and the boats miraculously made it through the rapids and a day later, startled a Mormon homesteader on the mouth of the Virgin River. The Powell expedition had made it down the Colorado River. The three men were never seen alive again. There is still controversy, but the leading theory for what happened to them is that they were killed, shot by Shivwit indians after a miscommunication. </p>

					<h4>What made Powell so unique?</h4> 

					<p>It is strange that a few years after his men were murdered that Powell would make the effort to live with the very tribe that had reportedly killed them. This was in an era where it was unusual for white people to approach native people’s at all. But as Powell Historian Mark Law explains, “that was just part of his genius.” Since childhood Native Americans, their history and their alien ways of life had fascinated him. It was his fascination with the area and his dedication to the burgeoning field of natural science that he went to the West year after year. Powell would make a career out of contributing to the study of the West and its native people. His time with the native people would contribute significantly to his later ideas on the capacity of the Western lands he helped chart. </p>

					<p>After the continental wars of the mid-century, it was a national interest to encourage people to populate it, both as a national security issue – to strengthen a tenuous claim by working the land AND to produce goods in service of the national economy. Powell agreed with the impulse to encourage settlement in the West, but differed from his contemporaries’ spurious claims, hyperbolic suggestions, and in accurate science in attempts to do so. </p>

					<p>What made Powell different from those like ____ Gilpin, who claimed that “QUOTE” or _______________ who claimed that rain would “follow the plow” and make tilling desert soils fruitful?</p>

					<p>Joseph Powell, Powell’s father, was an itinerant Methodist preacher whose frequent absences meant ‘Wes’ often managed the farm and his other siblings. He knew and respected the hard work that went into farming. He had seen the Civil War and knew about the consequences of quarrelling between states over resources. Most of all, Powell was a self-described naturalist. In the depths of his canyon expeditions he regularly risked his life and remaining limbs in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. This inoculated him against fevered hyperbole. The result was respect for the potential in provable facts and testable hypotheses. After spending time with Native American Tribes like the Shivwit, Southern Ute and Hopi, Powell fundamentally understood that water was the major limiting factor in developing the West. Importantly, Powell didn’t argue with progress; in his Arid Lands report to congress after his second expedition down the Colorado River, he offered pragmatic ways to use the land that were born of his experiential understanding of the land he had, in part gained through the generations of his Native American teachers.  In his report, Powell laid out his ideas that the Government should take a hand in social engineering in the West by granting people large tracts of land on which they would be encouraged to form small communities and herd or graze cows or sheep. This community would subsistence farm with the help of a small dams or diversion on tributaries of the Colorado. His ideas emphasized the importance of watersheds in political negotiations, and foresaw squabbling over water that flowed crosses state borders.</p>

					<h4>“All Used Up”</h4>
					<p>The tribes who had influenced Powell had predecessors. Named in the O’odham language to mean “all used up,” we will probably never know what a massive pre-historic North American civilization called itself. We do know the Hohokam were extensive, about 60-80,000 people at it’s peak, supported by an estimated 110,000 acres. They worked the land around central Arizona for more than ten centuries before scientists believe their reliance on the Salt River made them vulnerable to an extended drought and their civilization collapsed around 1450 A.D. </p>

					<p>The canals were complicated feats of engineering. Canals require complex math, it’s not so much just a way to carry water from the river to the field, but they must do so gradually. The Hohokam knew that too much gradient and the moving water would dig out the channel, too slow and the water would get backlogged. The physics of moving water also demanded the canal systems be entirely calculated before construction. You could not just extend the canal after water entered the system, as the rest of the system had been planned for a set amount of water to flow through its channels and fields. To add on to a passive canal system like the Hohokam’s would be like adding an extra limb to a living body. The Hohokam’s canals lose about 1-2 feet per mile of canal, a feat that is hard to accomplish even with today’s modern equipment. </p>

					<p>Not only are there engineering implications to the Hohokam irrigation projects, but there are obvious socio-economic implications too. Dr. Jerry Howard, an expert on the Hohokam looks at modern societies using irrigation to arrive at commonalities that may have been true for the Hohokam. “Irrigators always squabble,” he says in reference to one of his findings. “Quote with more explanation.”</p>

					<p>Almost four hundred years later, in 1867, two years before Powell’s expedition, Jack Swilling noticed fertile soils along the Salt River. He saw an opportunity for growth and formed the Jack Swilling Irrigation Canal Company. He and others excavated an ancient canal and began raising crops in the Valley of the Sun. As more people joined the settlement, Swilling, a Confederate veteran, suggested naming it Stonewall, after the general. They went with Phoenix, as their town was rising from the ashes of an ancient civilization. In 1880 their population was 2,453; in 1920 it was 20,000. </p>

					<h4>In a bind</h4>
					<p>John Wesley Powell was stuck. In search of pitch from Pinyon Pines to caulk what was left of the Colorado River Exploring Expedition boats, Powell now found himself braced halfway up a chimney of rock, thousands of feet above the Colorado River and his men recuperating in the camp below. He couldn’t down-climb without risking a deadly fall to the narrow ledge he had started from, and the chimney began to widen above him. Finding himself unable to go up or down, he went sideways, further into the crevice he was wedged in. Here, he was able to rest enough to keep climbing, topping out to the rare sight of a sky un-confined by canyon walls. </p>
					
					<p>It was at this point that Major Powell realized his mistake. Although he’d brought a barometer with him that had admittedly made “climbing hard,” he had nothing with which to gather the tree sap. “QUOTE ABOUT SLEEVE.” </p>

					<p>Had it only been eight years since he had enlisted in the Union Army? A son of immigrants, Powell was simultaneously driven by his childhood interest in natural history and a nationalistic pride in the country developing before his eyes. Lincoln was a personal hero of his, yet he was reluctant to experience the front and hoped to be assigned as a fortifications engineer. He found himself in a more active post, leading an artillery brigade, when a lead Minnie ball at the battle of Shiloh struck his right arm above the wrist as he raised it to signal the artillery men he commanded. Remembering the destruction later, he wrote “I scarcely noticed until I attempted to mount my horse.” Powell was tossed 20,000 men died that day. It was the bloodiest battle of the Civil War up to that point. </p>

					<h4>Geological Time</h4>
					<p>After making barometric measurements critical to mapping the course of the river, the point of the whole expedition in the first place, Powell noticed a storm rising on the horizon. In the desert, storms were quick, destructive and powered large events called geologists call “mass wasting”. Arid desert soils are don’t soak up rains and the water masses and mobs down the landscape, when it encounters a canyon, the water’s velocity and force overwhelm the upper walls. Boulder studded debris screams down the cliffs, revealing new landscapes in its path. What Powell witnessed on his way down the cliffs was a small incident in the life of a canyon, but a life threatening force of nature to the lives of the nine men who had accompanied him on his self-funded expedition. As he hurried down the cliffs to warn them, Powell knew that two forces shape a canyon, and both depend on the interplay between rock and water. </p>

					<p>At a time where many people believed the earth was thousands of years old, geology attracted people who contemplated and wondered at the staggering amount of time that held the capacity to carve out landscapes, witness the origin and extinction of species and ossify unknown life forms in ancient muds. And the American Southwest was a perfect place to see the scale of geological time splayed out before them. </p>

					<p>Canyons are scars of the battle between the water and the rising Colorado Plateau. The actual rocks that the Colorado slices through are about half as old as the earth itself, the oldest being about 2 billion years old. However, the river Powell likens to a saw slicing through the layers is much younger, about 2 million years old. What makes the Colorado so powerful is the sediment load it carries constantly sandblasts its own channel, grain by grain cutting itself deeper into its bed. The loss of elevation determines how fast that laden water moves. The Colorado cuts through the Colorado Plateau, which simultaneously experiences uplift while the ancient scattered tributaries assembled into the river we now know. As the plateau gradually rose, the eastern side went slightly higher, and year-by-year its waterways gained speed, liquid running off a table that was being tilted.</p>

					<p>The barometric readings Powell took at the top of the cliffs were scientifically critical to determining their elevation relative to sea level, but were meaningful to his crew of mountain men veterans and buckskin ramblers below because it might provide a scanty clue of what to expect.</p>

					<p>Throughout the expedition, the element that plagued the men the most was the unknown. Being the first, meant they would never know what was around the next bend. It could be uninterrupted swift-moving calm waters that could carry them 40 miles in a day, or it could be the clean thin line and distant roar which would be their introduction to a waterfall and sure destruction. The men depended on the fact that they would be able to beach above rapids and “line” the boats down bad rapids. But they knew they couldn’t depend on that through the whole trip. Knowing their elevation and their distance left to travel, they could estimate if they were gradually losing elevation or if they would be left with hundreds of feet to somehow descend in the last stretches. When they had set off, they truly only knew one thing, if disaster struck, there were few chances for escape. </p>

					<p>Later down the river, far away from Cataract Canyon, Powell was in another bind. This one kept him up in the middle of the night with a decision. He was charismatic and decisive, but Powell had trouble as a leader. Powell took his dinners apart from the other men, insisted on taking scientific measurements despite dwindling food stores, and had never quite forgiven Oromel Howland for losing records and maps in a rapid months earlier. All of these things contributed to the bad blood the group faced almost three months into the trip. The barometers were all long busted and the remaining nine men were down to their last few pounds of wormy flour. The crew was camped above what one member recorded in his journal as emphatically the worst rapid they had seen yet, the sight of which compelled three members of the crew, brothers Oramel and Seneca Howland and Andrew Dunn, to decide to chance the cliffs and the desert beyond rather than follow Powell down the river. That night, Powell lay awake with the roar of the next days’ rapids in his head agonizing. At three in the morning, he woke Oramel Howland and tried to convince him to change his mind. The adversity they’d been through: the near drownings, the campfires, the fights, the horrible food, the trust that had withstood all that had somehow evaporated. Oramel refused. Neither side would follow the other into what they thought was sure death.</p>

					<p>With tears streaming down bearded faces, the two factions parted. The three wouldn’t take their part of the rations with them, so one from the boats placed some precious food where they would find it on their way out of the canyon. Powell and the boats miraculously made it through the rapids and a day later, startled a Mormon homesteader on the mouth of the Virgin River. The Powell expedition had made it down the Colorado River. The three men were never seen alive again. There is still controversy, but the leading theory for what happened to them is that they were killed, shot by Shivwit indians after a miscommunication. </p>

					<h4>What made Powell so unique?</h4> 

					<p>It is strange that a few years after his men were murdered that Powell would make the effort to live with the very tribe that had reportedly killed them. This was in an era where it was unusual for white people to approach native people’s at all. But as Powell Historian Mark Law explains, “that was just part of his genius.” Since childhood Native Americans, their history and their alien ways of life had fascinated him. It was his fascination with the area and his dedication to the burgeoning field of natural science that he went to the West year after year. Powell would make a career out of contributing to the study of the West and its native people. His time with the native people would contribute significantly to his later ideas on the capacity of the Western lands he helped chart. </p>

					<p>After the continental wars of the mid-century, it was a national interest to encourage people to populate it, both as a national security issue – to strengthen a tenuous claim by working the land AND to produce goods in service of the national economy. Powell agreed with the impulse to encourage settlement in the West, but differed from his contemporaries’ spurious claims, hyperbolic suggestions, and in accurate science in attempts to do so. </p>

					<p>What made Powell different from those like ____ Gilpin, who claimed that “QUOTE” or _______________ who claimed that rain would “follow the plow” and make tilling desert soils fruitful?</p>

					<p>Joseph Powell, Powell’s father, was an itinerant Methodist preacher whose frequent absences meant ‘Wes’ often managed the farm and his other siblings. He knew and respected the hard work that went into farming. He had seen the Civil War and knew about the consequences of quarrelling between states over resources. Most of all, Powell was a self-described naturalist. In the depths of his canyon expeditions he regularly risked his life and remaining limbs in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. This inoculated him against fevered hyperbole. The result was respect for the potential in provable facts and testable hypotheses. After spending time with Native American Tribes like the Shivwit, Southern Ute and Hopi, Powell fundamentally understood that water was the major limiting factor in developing the West. Importantly, Powell didn’t argue with progress; in his Arid Lands report to congress after his second expedition down the Colorado River, he offered pragmatic ways to use the land that were born of his experiential understanding of the land he had, in part gained through the generations of his Native American teachers.  In his report, Powell laid out his ideas that the Government should take a hand in social engineering in the West by granting people large tracts of land on which they would be encouraged to form small communities and herd or graze cows or sheep. This community would subsistence farm with the help of a small dams or diversion on tributaries of the Colorado. His ideas emphasized the importance of watersheds in political negotiations, and foresaw squabbling over water that flowed crosses state borders.</p>

					<h4>“All Used Up”</h4>
					<p>The tribes who had influenced Powell had predecessors. Named in the O’odham language to mean “all used up,” we will probably never know what a massive pre-historic North American civilization called itself. We do know the Hohokam were extensive, about 60-80,000 people at it’s peak, supported by an estimated 110,000 acres. They worked the land around central Arizona for more than ten centuries before scientists believe their reliance on the Salt River made them vulnerable to an extended drought and their civilization collapsed around 1450 A.D. </p>

					<p>The canals were complicated feats of engineering. Canals require complex math, it’s not so much just a way to carry water from the river to the field, but they must do so gradually. The Hohokam knew that too much gradient and the moving water would dig out the channel, too slow and the water would get backlogged. The physics of moving water also demanded the canal systems be entirely calculated before construction. You could not just extend the canal after water entered the system, as the rest of the system had been planned for a set amount of water to flow through its channels and fields. To add on to a passive canal system like the Hohokam’s would be like adding an extra limb to a living body. The Hohokam’s canals lose about 1-2 feet per mile of canal, a feat that is hard to accomplish even with today’s modern equipment. </p>

					<p>Not only are there engineering implications to the Hohokam irrigation projects, but there are obvious socio-economic implications too. Dr. Jerry Howard, an expert on the Hohokam looks at modern societies using irrigation to arrive at commonalities that may have been true for the Hohokam. “Irrigators always squabble,” he says in reference to one of his findings. “Quote with more explanation.”</p>

					<p>Almost four hundred years later, in 1867, two years before Powell’s expedition, Jack Swilling noticed fertile soils along the Salt River. He saw an opportunity for growth and formed the Jack Swilling Irrigation Canal Company. He and others excavated an ancient canal and began raising crops in the Valley of the Sun. As more people joined the settlement, Swilling, a Confederate veteran, suggested naming it Stonewall, after the general. They went with Phoenix, as their town was rising from the ashes of an ancient civilization. In 1880 their population was 2,453; in 1920 it was 20,000. </p>

					<p>Literally built on the ruins of a civilization that failed because of its reliance on the Salt River, a tributary of the Colorado, Phoenix is the exact opposite of Powell’s ideas on how to develop the West. But what could have been done? Once the groove of settlement is scratched into benevolent land, it is hard to reverse it. It’s human nature for people adhere to these small outposts and use their ingenuity to improve the opportunities they find. People, like water, start across a landscape following the path of lease resistance around obstacles. Once established, halting development of a city like Phoenix is like trying to stop a river.  

					<p>Change is inevitable, it happens in large earth shattering events, like the mass wasting Powell saw hurtling down the cliffs, or the Colorado River Compact, ratified in 1928 which ignored Powell’s advice and became the scaffolding for more than a century of water exploitation and grandiose engineering projects on the Colorado. But change also happens incrementally, grain by grain, person by person. </p>

Knowing their elevation and their distance left to travel, they could estimate if they were gradually losing elevation or if they would be left with hundreds of feet to somehow descend in the last stretches. When they had set off, they truly only knew one thing, if disaster struck, there were few chances for escape. </p>

					<p>Later down the river, far away from Cataract Canyon, Powell was in another bind. This one kept him up in the middle of the night with a decision. He was charismatic and decisive, but Powell had trouble as a leader. Powell took his dinners apart from the other men, insisted on taking scientific measurements despite dwindling food stores, and had never quite forgiven Oromel Howland for losing records and maps in a rapid months earlier. All of these things contributed to the bad blood the group faced almost three months into the trip. The barometers were all long busted and the remaining nine men were down to their last few pounds of wormy flour. The crew was camped above what one member recorded in his journal as emphatically the worst rapid they had seen yet, the sight of which compelled three members of the crew, brothers Oramel and Seneca Howland and Andrew Dunn, to decide to chance the cliffs and the desert beyond rather than follow Powell down the river. That night, Powell lay awake with the roar of the next days’ rapids in his head agonizing. At three in the morning, he woke Oramel Howland and tried to convince him to change his mind. The adversity they’d been through: the near drownings, the campfires, the fights, the horrible food, the trust that had withstood all that had somehow evaporated. Oramel refused. Neither side would follow the other into what they thought was sure death.</p>

					<p>With tears streaming down bearded faces, the two factions parted. The three wouldn’t take their part of the rations with them, so one from the boats placed some precious food where they would find it on their way out of the canyon. Powell and the boats miraculously made it through the rapids and a day later, startled a Mormon homesteader on the mouth of the Virgin River. The Powell expedition had made it down the Colorado River. The three men were never seen alive again. There is still controversy, but the leading theory for what happened to them is that they were killed, shot by Shivwit indians after a miscommunication. </p>

					<h4>What made Powell so unique?</h4> 

					<p>It is strange that a few years after his men were murdered that Powell would make the effort to live with the very tribe that had reportedly killed them. This was in an era where it was unusual for white people to approach native people’s at all. But as Powell Historian Mark Law explains, “that was just part of his genius.” Since childhood Native Americans, their history and their alien ways of life had fascinated him. It was his fascination with the area and his dedication to the burgeoning field of natural science that he went to the West year after year. Powell would make a career out of contributing to the study of the West and its native people. His time with the native people would contribute significantly to his later ideas on the capacity of the Western lands he helped chart. </p>

					<p>After the continental wars of the mid-century, it was a national interest to encourage people to populate it, both as a national security issue – to strengthen a tenuous claim by working the land AND to produce goods in service of the national economy. Powell agreed with the impulse to encourage settlement in the West, but differed from his contemporaries’ spurious claims, hyperbolic suggestions, and in accurate science in attempts to do so. </p>

					<p>What made Powell different from those like ____ Gilpin, who claimed that “QUOTE” or _______________ who claimed that rain would “follow the plow” and make tilling desert soils fruitful?</p>

					<p>Joseph Powell, Powell’s father, was an itinerant Methodist preacher whose frequent absences meant ‘Wes’ often managed the farm and his other siblings. He knew and respected the hard work that went into farming. He had seen the Civil War and knew about the consequences of quarrelling between states over resources. Most of all, Powell was a self-described naturalist. In the depths of his canyon expeditions he regularly risked his life and remaining limbs in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. This inoculated him against fevered hyperbole. The result was respect for the potential in provable facts and testable hypotheses. After spending time with Native American Tribes like the Shivwit, Southern Ute and Hopi, Powell fundamentally understood that water was the major limiting factor in developing the West. Importantly, Powell didn’t argue with progress; in his Arid Lands report to congress after his second expedition down the Colorado River, he offered pragmatic ways to use the land that were born of his experiential understanding of the land he had, in part gained through the generations of his Native American teachers.  In his report, Powell laid out his ideas that the Government should take a hand in social engineering in the West by granting people large tracts of land on which they would be encouraged to form small communities and herd or graze cows or sheep. This community would subsistence farm with the help of a small dams or diversion on tributaries of the Colorado. His ideas emphasized the importance of watersheds in political negotiations, and foresaw squabbling over water that flowed crosses state borders.</p>

					<h4>“All Used Up”</h4>
					<p>The tribes who had influenced Powell had predecessors. Named in the O’odham language to mean “all used up,” we will probably never know what a massive pre-historic North American civilization called itself. We do know the Hohokam were extensive, about 60-80,000 people at it’s peak, supported by an estimated 110,000 acres. They worked the land around central Arizona for more than ten centuries before scientists believe their reliance on the Salt River made them vulnerable to an extended drought and their civilization collapsed around 1450 A.D. </p>

					<p>The canals were complicated feats of engineering. Canals require complex math, it’s not so much just a way to carry water from the river to the field, but they must do so gradually. The Hohokam knew that too much gradient and the moving water would dig out the channel, too slow and the water would get backlogged. The physics of moving water also demanded the canal systems be entirely calculated before construction. You could not just extend the canal after water entered the system, as the rest of the system had been planned for a set amount of water to flow through its channels and fields. To add on to a passive canal system like the Hohokam’s would be like adding an extra limb to a living body. The Hohokam’s canals lose about 1-2 feet per mile of canal, a feat that is hard to accomplish even with today’s modern equipment. </p>

					<p>Not only are there engineering implications to the Hohokam irrigation projects, but there are obvious socio-economic implications too. Dr. Jerry Howard, an expert on the Hohokam looks at modern societies using irrigation to arrive at commonalities that may have been true for the Hohokam. “Irrigators always squabble,” he says in reference to one of his findings. “Quote with more explanation.”</p>

					<p>Almost four hundred years later, in 1867, two years before Powell’s expedition, Jack Swilling noticed fertile soils along the Salt River. He saw an opportunity for growth and formed the Jack Swilling Irrigation Canal Company. He and others excavated an ancient canal and began raising crops in the Valley of the Sun. As more people joined the settlement, Swilling, a Confederate veteran, suggested naming it Stonewall, after the general. They went with Phoenix, as their town was rising from the ashes of an ancient civilization. In 1880 their population was 2,453; in 1920 it was 20,000. </p>

					<p>Literally built on the ruins of a civilization that failed because of its reliance on the Salt River, a tributary of the Colorado, Phoenix is the exact opposite of Powell’s ideas on how to develop the West. But what could have been done? Once the groove of settlement is scratched into benevolent land, it is hard to reverse it. It’s human nature for people adhere to these small outposts and use their ingenuity to improve the opportunities they find. People, like water, start across a landscape following the path of lease resistance around obstacles. Once established, halting development of a city like Phoenix is like trying to stop a river.  

					<p>Change is inevitable, it happens in large earth shattering events, like the mass wasting Powell saw hurtling down the cliffs, or the Colorado River Compact, ratified in 1928 which ignored Powell’s advice and became the scaffolding for more than a century of water exploitation and grandiose engineering projects on the Colorado. But change also happens incrementally, grain by grain, person by person. </p>
