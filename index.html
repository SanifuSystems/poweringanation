					<h4>In a bind</h4>
					<p>John Wesley Powell was stuck. In search of pitch from Pinyon Pines to caulk what was left of the Colorado River Exploring Expedition boats, Powell now found himself braced halfway up a chimney of rock, thousands of feet above the Colorado River and his men recuperating in the camp below. He couldn’t down-climb without risking a deadly fall to the narrow ledge he had started from, and the chimney began to widen above him. Finding himself unable to go up or down, he went sideways, further into the crevice he was wedged in. Here, he was able to rest enough to keep climbing, topping out to the rare sight of a sky un-confined by canyon walls. </p>
					
					<p>It was at this point that Major Powell realized his mistake. Although he’d brought a barometer with him that had admittedly made “climbing hard,” he had nothing with which to gather the tree sap. “QUOTE ABOUT SLEEVE.” </p>

					<p>Had it only been eight years since he had enlisted in the Union Army? A son of immigrants, Powell was simultaneously driven by his childhood interest in natural history and a nationalistic pride in the country developing before his eyes. Lincoln was a personal hero of his, yet he was reluctant to experience the front and hoped to be assigned as a fortifications engineer. He found himself in a more active post, leading an artillery brigade, when a lead Minnie ball at the battle of Shiloh struck his right arm above the wrist as he raised it to signal the artillery men he commanded. Remembering the destruction later, he wrote “I scarcely noticed until I attempted to mount my horse.” Powell was tossed 20,000 men died that day. It was the bloodiest battle of the Civil War up to that point. </p>

					<h4>Geological Time</h4>
					<p>After making barometric measurements critical to mapping the course of the river, the point of the whole expedition in the first place, Powell noticed a storm rising on the horizon. In the desert, storms were quick, destructive and powered large events called geologists call “mass wasting”. Arid desert soils are don’t soak up rains and the water masses and mobs down the landscape, when it encounters a canyon, the water’s velocity and force overwhelm the upper walls. Boulder studded debris screams down the cliffs, revealing new landscapes in its path. What Powell witnessed on his way down the cliffs was a small incident in the life of a canyon, but a life threatening force of nature to the lives of the nine men who had accompanied him on his self-funded expedition. As he hurried down the cliffs to warn them, Powell knew that two forces shape a canyon, and both depend on the interplay between rock and water. </p>

					<p>At a time where many people believed the earth was thousands of years old, geology attracted people who contemplated and wondered at the staggering amount of time that held the capacity to carve out landscapes, witness the origin and extinction of species and ossify unknown life forms in ancient muds. And the American Southwest was a perfect place to see the scale of geological time splayed out before them. </p>

					<p>Canyons are scars of the battle between the water and the rising Colorado Plateau. The actual rocks that the Colorado slices through are about half as old as the earth itself, the oldest being about 2 billion years old. However, the river Powell likens to a saw slicing through the layers is much younger, about 2 million years old. What makes the Colorado so powerful is the sediment load it carries constantly sandblasts its own channel, grain by grain cutting itself deeper into its bed. The loss of elevation determines how fast that laden water moves. The Colorado cuts through the Colorado Plateau, which simultaneously experiences uplift while the ancient scattered tributaries assembled into the river we now know. As the plateau gradually rose, the eastern side went slightly higher, and year-by-year its waterways gained speed, liquid running off a table that was being tilted.</p>

					<p>The barometric readings Powell took at the top of the cliffs were scientifically critical to determining their elevation relative to sea level, but were meaningful to his crew of mountain men veterans and buckskin ramblers below because it might provide a scanty clue of what to expect.</p>

					<p>Throughout the expedition, the element that plagued the men the most was the unknown. Being the first, meant they would never know what was around the next bend. It could be uninterrupted swift-moving calm waters that could carry them 40 miles in a day, or it could be the clean thin line and distant roar which would be their introduction to a waterfall and sure destruction. The men depended on the fact that they would be able to beach above rapids and “line” the boats down bad rapids. But they knew they couldn’t depend on that through the whole trip. Knowing their elevation and their distance left to travel, they could estimate if they were gradually losing elevation or if they would be left with hundreds of feet to somehow descend in the last stretches. When they had set off, they truly only knew one thing, if disaster struck, there were few chances for escape. </p>

					<p>Later down the river, far away from Cataract Canyon, Powell was in another bind. This one kept him up in the middle of the night with a decision. He was charismatic and decisive, but Powell had trouble as a leader. Powell took his dinners apart from the other men, insisted on taking scientific measurements despite dwindling food stores, and had never quite forgiven Oromel Howland for losing records and maps in a rapid months earlier. All of these things contributed to the bad blood the group faced almost three months into the trip. The barometers were all long busted and the remaining nine men were down to their last few pounds of wormy flour. The crew was camped above what one member recorded in his journal as emphatically the worst rapid they had seen yet, the sight of which compelled three members of the crew, brothers Oramel and Seneca Howland and Andrew Dunn, to decide to chance the cliffs and the desert beyond rather than follow Powell down the river. That night, Powell lay awake with the roar of the next days’ rapids in his head agonizing. At three in the morning, he woke Oramel Howland and tried to convince him to change his mind. The adversity they’d been through: the near drownings, the campfires, the fights, the horrible food, the trust that had withstood all that had somehow evaporated. Oramel refused. Neither side would follow the other into what they thought was sure death.</p>

					<p>With tears streaming down bearded faces, the two factions parted. The three wouldn’t take their part of the rations with them, so one from the boats placed some precious food where they would find it on their way out of the canyon. Powell and the boats miraculously made it through the rapids and a day later, startled a Mormon homesteader on the mouth of the Virgin River. The Powell expedition had made it down the Colorado River. The three men were never seen alive again. There is still controversy, but the leading theory for what happened to them is that they were killed, shot by Shivwit indians after a miscommunication. </p>

					<h4>What made Powell so unique?</h4> 

					<p>It is strange that a few years after his men were murdered that Powell would make the effort to live with the very tribe that had reportedly killed them. This was in an era where it was unusual for white people to approach native people’s at all. But as Powell Historian Mark Law explains, “that was just part of his genius.” Since childhood Native Americans, their history and their alien ways of life had fascinated him. It was his fascination with the area and his dedication to the burgeoning field of natural science that he went to the West year after year. Powell would make a career out of contributing to the study of the West and its native people. His time with the native people would contribute significantly to his later ideas on the capacity of the Western lands he helped chart. </p>

					<p>After the continental wars of the mid-century, it was a national interest to encourage people to populate it, both as a national security issue – to strengthen a tenuous claim by working the land AND to produce goods in service of the national economy. Powell agreed with the impulse to encourage settlement in the West, but differed from his contemporaries’ spurious claims, hyperbolic suggestions, and in accurate science in attempts to do so. </p>

					<p>What made Powell different from those like ____ Gilpin, who claimed that “QUOTE” or _______________ who claimed that rain would “follow the plow” and make tilling desert soils fruitful?</p>

					<p>Joseph Powell, Powell’s father, was an itinerant Methodist preacher whose frequent absences meant ‘Wes’ often managed the farm and his other siblings. He knew and respected the hard work that went into farming. He had seen the Civil War and knew about the consequences of quarrelling between states over resources. Most of all, Powell was a self-described naturalist. In the depths of his canyon expeditions he regularly risked his life and remaining limbs in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. This inoculated him against fevered hyperbole. The result was respect for the potential in provable facts and testable hypotheses. After spending time with Native American Tribes like the Shivwit, Southern Ute and Hopi, Powell fundamentally understood that water was the major limiting factor in developing the West. Importantly, Powell didn’t argue with progress; in his Arid Lands report to congress after his second expedition down the Colorado River, he offered pragmatic ways to use the land that were born of his experiential understanding of the land he had, in part gained through the generations of his Native American teachers.  In his report, Powell laid out his ideas that the Government should take a hand in social engineering in the West by granting people large tracts of land on which they would be encouraged to form small communities and herd or graze cows or sheep. This community would subsistence farm with the help of a small dams or diversion on tributaries of the Colorado. His ideas emphasized the importance of watersheds in political negotiations, and foresaw squabbling over water that flowed crosses state borders.</p>

					<h4>“All Used Up”</h4>
					<p>The tribes who had influenced Powell had predecessors. Named in the O’odham language to mean “all used up,” we will probably never know what a massive pre-historic North American civilization called itself. We do know the Hohokam were extensive, about 60-80,000 people at it’s peak, supported by an estimated 110,000 acres. They worked the land around central Arizona for more than ten centuries before scientists believe their reliance on the Salt River made them vulnerable to an extended drought and their civilization collapsed around 1450 A.D. </p>

					<p>The canals were complicated feats of engineering. Canals require complex math, it’s not so much just a way to carry water from the river to the field, but they must do so gradually. The Hohokam knew that too much gradient and the moving water would dig out the channel, too slow and the water would get backlogged. The physics of moving water also demanded the canal systems be entirely calculated before construction. You could not just extend the canal after water entered the system, as the rest of the system had been planned for a set amount of water to flow through its channels and fields. To add on to a passive canal system like the Hohokam’s would be like adding an extra limb to a living body. The Hohokam’s canals lose about 1-2 feet per mile of canal, a feat that is hard to accomplish even with today’s modern equipment. </p>

					<p>Not only are there engineering implications to the Hohokam irrigation projects, but there are obvious socio-economic implications too. Dr. Jerry Howard, an expert on the Hohokam looks at modern societies using irrigation to arrive at commonalities that may have been true for the Hohokam. “Irrigators always squabble,” he says in reference to one of his findings. “Quote with more explanation.”</p>

					<p>Almost four hundred years later, in 1867, two years before Powell’s expedition, Jack Swilling noticed fertile soils along the Salt River. He saw an opportunity for growth and formed the Jack Swilling Irrigation Canal Company. He and others excavated an ancient canal and began raising crops in the Valley of the Sun. As more people joined the settlement, Swilling, a Confederate veteran, suggested naming it Stonewall, after the general. They went with Phoenix, as their town was rising from the ashes of an ancient civilization. In 1880 their population was 2,453; in 1920 it was 20,000. </p>

					<p>Literally built on the ruins of a civilization that failed because of its reliance on the Salt River, a tributary of the Colorado, Phoenix is the exact opposite of Powell’s ideas on how to develop the West. But what could have been done? Once the groove of settlement is scratched into benevolent land, it is hard to reverse it. It’s human nature for people adhere to these small outposts and use their ingenuity to improve the opportunities they find. People, like water, start across a landscape following the path of lease resistance around obstacles. Once established, halting development of a city like Phoenix is like trying to stop a river.  

					<p>Change is inevitable, it happens in large earth shattering events, like the mass wasting Powell saw hurtling down the cliffs, or the Colorado River Compact, ratified in 1928 which ignored Powell’s advice and became the scaffolding for more than a century of water exploitation and grandiose engineering projects on the Colorado. But change also happens incrementally, grain by grain, person by person. </p>

						<h4>GOING WITH THE FLOW</h4>
					<p>
					<span class="openingQuote">“One does not really conquer a place like this. One inhabits it like an occupying army and makes, at best, an uneasy truce with it.” - Marc Reisner,	<em>Cadillac Desert</em></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>MINIDOKA IRRIGATION PROJECT, IDAHO, 1960s</em>. Robert King, bundled in flannels and wearing thick boots, pulls a cumbersome siphon from the ditch that divides his family’s 200-acre farm. He maneuvers
						the siphon to a furrow in the soil, sprinkled with budding wheat, alfalfa and potatoes. The wind picks up, hurling dust and water everywhere. If it were
						warmer, he thinks, he wouldn’t mind getting wet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Shielding his eyes and shivering as spring chill whips about him, King can just make out where the ditch tumbles over a nearby hill. Beyond it, Minidoka
						Dam holds back the farm’s lifeblood in Walcott Lake; without the lake and the sinuous Snake River that feeds it, thirsty crops wouldn’t stand a chance.
					</p>
					<p>
						The opportunity to care for this land came twelve years earlier, his father, Vern King, returned to Idaho from combat in Korea. He wrested an opportunity
						to start fresh by entering a Bureau of Reclamation lottery to win land in the Minidoka Irrigation Project, the million-acre expanse where he had grown up
						working on his father’s farm.
					</p>
					<p>
						“All the local veterans put in for it, and he was the only one who was drawn,” King says proudly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Foregoing an engineering degree at Michigan State University, Vern King brought his wife and then 1-year-old son Robert nine miles down the road from his
						grandfather’s farm to start his own. If Vern could irrigate unruly volcanic dirt successfully within a few years — with the help of government-built
						waterways — he could keep it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nearly 60 years later, the farm still operates with the younger King’s cousin at the helm. It hasn’t been easy, King says, but for the families who figured
						out the land, it was worth it — just as settlers moving west had learned as early as the mid-1800s.
					</p>
					<p>
						Congress supported agriculture to encourage Western settlement, King notes. “They generated the opportunity for farmers in the West to generate revenue.”
						Irrigation, he adds, “allows us to have the kind of country that we have today.”
					</p>
					<p>
					Today, people still flock west. Irrigation supports more than 40 million people in the Colorado River Basin’s <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/126494/Colorado-River">246,000 square mile</a>s of riverbed, farmland and cities in some of the	<a href="http://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/map/drought/US#app=cdo">driest (and still drying) states in the country</a>. When presented with a map of the region,
						some wonder why the largest populations of Americans using the Colorado are nowhere near it. They wonder why western cities and

					“People seem to think that we delight in destroying the environment,” says King, speaking as an	<a href="http://www.usbr.gov/uc/rm/amp/amwg/amwgbioALT_king.html">interstate water policymaker in Utah</a>. Similar to his childhood spent irrigating a
						farm but on a much grander scale, King works with people from each basin state to create strategies in operating dams along the Colorado. It’s not his job
						to tell people how to use their water, he says, but to make sure water managers take only their designated shares of it. Today the river is managed based
						on “a series of tradeoffs made in the past,” he notes.
					</p>
					<p>
						“We’re still trying to minimize the environmental impact with what’s already there and what’s already developed,” he says, but dams “are an integral
						function of being able to live in the West.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Historically, civilizations rose along the banks of freshwater sources, with bodies of water defining city-planning schemes. But cities using the Colorado
						River couldn’t be restricted to and defined by a river. They sought to define it instead, tugging silty flows throughout the Southwest to make the desert
						bloom, Keeping the river healthy hasn’t always been a priority, observers say.
					</p>
					<p>
						Historians and activists argue that the river’s shape today and the way Westerners have and do use it reflects a century of short-term solutions to
						problems that needed long-term ones.

						<h4> Establishing Claims </h4>
					</p>
					<p>
					<span class="openingQuote">“The settlement of the American West owed itself, as much as anything, to a hat made of beaver felt.” - Marc Reisner, <a><em>Cadillac Desert</em></a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						When President Thomas Jefferson bought 800,000 square miles of land from Napoleon in 1803 for $15 million, he did so in part as a protectionist measure.
					</p>
					<p>
					“One of the lessons of the settling of North America by European nations was that, to hold onto land, you needed to settle the land,” says water expert	<a href="http://lawweb.colorado.edu/profiles/profile.jsp?id=87">Doug Kenney</a>. “Ensuring settlement became a high national security objective.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Fearing a <a href="http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/LewisAndClark">possible French </a>empire in North America (and lingering Spanish and British
						aspirations), Jefferson jumped to claim the region first and then see what it was worth.
						<s>
						</s>
						However, his proactive measures set a precedent for American motivations that influenced resource use: Take it before someone else can.
					</p>
					<p>
						With vulnerable country and little direction as to what to do with it, Jefferson deployed Army volunteers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to reconnoiter
						the West under the pretext of monopolizing fur trading with natives before the British could.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lewis and Clark’s evaluations were inconclusive, but many contemporaries’ appraisals of the land were clear-cut. Explorer Zebulon Pike said that Americans
						should “leave the prairies incapable of cultivation to the wandering and uncivilized.” The reaction to Lewis and Clark’s reports confirmed as much; their
						reports
						<s>
						</s>
						resonated with fur-trapping mountain men looking for beavers, wealth and adventure. They descended upon the region, collecting pelts in droves. Beaver
						populations, like many western resources, soon dwindled.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the War of 1812 substantially delayed British conquest in North America, Americans weren’t so much concerned with taking things first but in claiming
						what they considered rightfully theirs. Gov. William Gilpin of the Colorado Territory was an early proponent of Manifest Destiny, the idea that Americans
					were meant to conquer the continent. He envisioned that ideal empire in his book <a></a><a href="http://archive.org/stream/centralgoldregi00gilpgoog#page/n8/mode/2up">The Central Gold Region</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although stunted, he wrote, the country could <a href="http://archive.org/stream/centralgoldregi00gilpgoog#page/n12/mode/2up">set the bar for empire</a> by
						constructing a transcontinental railroad. America, situated between Asia and Europe amidst a wealth of raw material, would “lead the host of nations to a
						new order of civilization” by developing faster trade, reaping profits from that trade and reinvesting in industry.
					</p>
					<p>
						Western senators, speculators and a burgeoning railroad industry agreed. A transcontinental railroad would reduce dependence on lengthy and costly maritime
						shipment of resources back East. States zigzagged with railroads would have greater chances of population growth and trade, extending not simply the U.S.
						flag but a very rich U.S. flag throughout the western territory.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only threat to that civilization: the wild lands in between. To Gilpin, river basins and mountains unsuitable for trains had no value. They were
						obstacles to progress until they were <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Manifest_Destiny">subdued</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Decision makers “weren't thinking ecologically,” says <a href="http://republicofnature.com/about-mark"></a>	<a href="http://republicofnature.com/about-mark">Mark Fiege</a>, a professor of history at Colorado State University. “They were thinking in a powerful way, but it was deeply reductive and very authoritarian toward the environment and toward people.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Early thinkers like Jefferson thought every civilization had a lifespan and that settling people in a new, undeveloped frontier with wealth potential could
						give America adrenalin.
					</p>
					<p>
						“The West was going to save the United States from inevitable decay” or forestall it, Fiege says. <a href="http://republicofnature.com/about-mark"></a>
						“They were going to trade space for time.”
					</p>
					<p>
						For development to happen, officials would need to do more than induce a few settlers into visiting the West. Under precedent of the Homestead Act of 1862,
						which gave settlers land in the Great Plains, politicians and businessmen set about devising how to induce a mass migration to western seaports and rivers
						close by. The West and its resources — <a>gold</a>, timber, coal, and the like — would be
						harvested and shaped to the will of the American people through small farming and land ownership.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>A Shallow Appraisal: Jumping the Gun</h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						At the first Irrigation Congress, held in Salt Lake City in 1893, scientist and explorer Major John Wesley Powell beseeched irrigation boosters to take a
						step back and look closely at the Colorado River basin’s capacity. He had rafted and assessed the river’s length and felt a need to burst their
						empire-focused bubble. Big players in the burgeoning irrigation movement bridled as Powell laid out the facts:
					</p>
					<p>
						<a
							href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tHRMRUH2XX0C&amp;pg=PA529&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;dq=john+wesley+powell+%22when+all+the+rivers+are+used%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-aTugZXHBD&amp;sig=2m4OrW_tIqKyrUBVFQbvgvsoUAM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JpXLUb7qHIHm9ASTooCIBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=john wesley powell &quot;when all the rivers are used&quot;&amp;f=false"
						>
							When all the rivers are used, when all the creeks in the ravines, when all the brooks, when all the springs are used, when all the reservoirs along the
							streams are used, when all the canyon waters are taken up, when all the artesian waters are taken up, when all the wells are sunk or dug that can be
							dug in all this arid region, there is still not sufficient water to irrigate all this arid region.
						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						But short-term greed and political goals made decision makers shortsighted. When economic depression hit in the 1890s, the need for immediate and sweeping
						solutions obscured honest recognition of what the West’s limited water resources could handle. Settlers must move West not only to improve America’s chance
						at continental empire, believed ‘Gilpinites’ who followed the principle of Manifest Destiny, but also to develop resources and build back the nation from
						depression and the Civil War as soon as possible. Somehow, the land would be irrigated.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1902, a handful of western senators who were interest in mobilizing promising raw materials in their states and increasing their populations finally
						found a friend in then President Theodore Roosevelt. In his first act as president, he authorized the creation of a new federal agency, the Reclamation
						Service, and put it to work manipulating western rivers. Irrigation projects would be funded through sale of public lands.
					</p>
					<p><span class="pullQuote">“Many projects thus wound up where they were bound to fail, though no one told the homesteaders.” 
					<span class="pullQuoteAuthor">-Dr. James Powell</span></span>
						At the same time, Roosevelt authorized the Newlands Act named for Sen. Francis Newlands of Nevada, which allowed farmers to keep land if they irrigated it
						with water from federal irrigation projects. The independently wealthy Newlands had attempted large-scale irrigation projects on his own but failed for
						lack of funding; he realized that only a budget as large as that of Congress’ would enable his dream.
					</p>
					<p>
					To rationally go about changing the landscape, science needed to refute Powell’s argument about the river basin’s limitations.	<a>In the face of evidence similar to the debate on climate change today,</a> a notion
					explained briefly as	<a href="http://search.proquest.com.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/docview/174410927/13ED1FF37B492C9FC1/3?accountid=14244">“rain follows the plow”</a> answered this
						need. No matter how arid the land, the idea held, farming would make the air around it more humid; tilling dirt exposed loamy earth that could better
						retain rain. Although the region usually did not get much rain, a climatic blip about that time made the West slightly wetter than usual, and the notion
						gained steam. With fervor stirred for land reclamation, people moved to the West.
					</p>
					<p>
						“I think they oversold it,” King says. “People didn’t realize how much hard work it would be.”
					</p>
					<p>
						King, whose first memory is being on a tractor at age 5, didn’t know anything but the farm until he was 20 years old. Today, he realizes how difficult
						working the land really was. Even farmers in the more modern-day Minidoka Project weren’t prepared, and they spent three years to clear plots of sage and
						rocks that hurt farm equipment, irrigate and put the land into full production. Unlike King, who was trained to work the land by both his father and
						grandfather, most settlers found they hadn’t been so clear on what to do with land they’d been hasty to nab.
					</p>
					<p>
						“It was dry and hot and windy, which are all things that are not as common back east,” King says. “It’s pretty bleak compared to say Illinois and Ohio
						where it’s green and lush.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Simply moving West proved not to be a farming panacea. Many didn’t know how to irrigate arid land, let alone any land. The ones who stuck with it couldn’t
						grow enough in the dry dirt to pay back their loans — most of the projects had been built where politicians wanted them, rather than where surveyors said
						they should be.
					</p>
					<p>
					“Many projects thus wound up where they were bound to fail,” Dr. James Powell writes in <em>Dead Pool</em></em>, his examination of reclamation, “though no one told the homesteaders.”
					</p>
					<p>
						After two decades of reclamation, only 11 percent of loans had been repaid. A

						released in 1924 revealed the Reclamation Service’s lack of oversight. Approximately 95 percent of all supposedly irrigated lands never had been. Somehow,
						projects had been built on private lands instead of the public ones whose sale
						would pay for dam construction. Congress gave prime public lands away for mining and railways, allowing railroad companies to create monopolies on plots
						nearest their tracks and to hike shipping costs to farmers. Many farmers quickly gave up, and the majority of those who didn’t could grow only cheap
					surplus crops like alfalfa and wheat, not earning enough to pay for use of water. The more loan defaults threatened, the more the Reclamation Service extended the loan period
						— to the point where many farmers would die before <a href="http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/rc97150t.pdf">repaying their loans</a>. Some sold land to
						speculators. All the while,

					“The sponsors of Federal reclamation believed it would be a simple matter to change arid, unimproved land into farms,” the study	<a href="http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/141RioGrande/141facts2.htm">authors wrote</a>. “Time has shown that this was a mistake. It is beginning
						to be realized that [irrigation] development requires a study of agricultural and economic problems, and the working out of settlement and development
						plans if the land is to be brought under cultivation without disastrous delays and waste of money and efforts.”
					</p>
					<p>
						By the time the study appeared, small farmers weren’t the Reclamation Service’s focus. As often happens after scandals, the Reclamation Service rebranded
						and changed its structure. It became the Bureau of Reclamation, an office under the direction of the Department of the Interior. It also began focusing

						<h4>Shifting Priorities </h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						The will to wrestle and overcome the environment came to a head with Southern Californians between 1900 and 1920. Residents of the newly rebranded Imperial
						Valley found themselves with a farming Mecca on their hands, save for the lack of a stable water supply. They looked hopefully between the roaring Colorado
						and the bed of what had once been the Alamo River.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1900, engineers from a private company redirected Colorado River water into the Alamo successfully but hastily; 700 miles of canals made 75,000 acres
						fit for farming, but the canals kept clogging with silt. As a solution, they cut a new canal across the border in Mexico. It started filling before the
						Mexican government approved it.
					</p>
					<p>
					Whether karma or climate, lead engineer C.R. Rockwood accidentally helped recreate not only the Alamo River but also a bygone inland lake named the Salton Sea.
						When the Colorado flooded in 1905, the river plunged into the Salton Trough — a sink big enough to hold more than half its annual flow – and destroyed

						, rendering the farmland permanently unworkable. A new canal – one that didn’t go through Mexico, to avoid any water conflicts – would be necessary.

					The Bureau of Reclamation had been busy with smaller projects during World War I, but by its end, dam booster and Powell’s nephew	<a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/537353699/13EE70BE59A6F4F755A/3?accountid=14244"> Arthur Powell Davis</a> was in charge. Powell Davis believed
						that only a dam could sustain cities in need of drinking water and put down the floods that threatened farms. What’s more, because the river plunges 12,000
						feet over the course of its 1,440-mile journey from WHERE to the Gulf of Mexico, the Colorado made dam hydropower effective and canals efficient. The
						residents of the Imperial Valley and Los Angeles were willing to lobby for the necessary waterworks: two channels and a flood-curbing dam.
					</p>
					<p>
						“The Reclamation Service sees the handwriting on the wall,” professor Fiege says. “They recognized that rural people are running into trouble, and they
						realized that if you want to have a political power base, you’ve got to look to where the population is, and that's the cities.”
					</p>
					<p>
						As early as 1900, author William Smythe did, too. Calling the rich soil along the Colorado’s banks a “gift of the river” for the purpose of American
						prosperity, he noted the significance of controlling water.

					<p><span class="pullQuote">“Water is the critical thing lacking to have a wonderful life. If you put yourself in the mindset of the people in the ‘20s and ‘30s I mean, we’d all build Hoover Dam if we could.”
					<span class="pullQuoteAuthor">-Dr. James Powell</span></span>
						Black Canyon, along the border of Arizona and Nevada, was chosen as the site of the Hoover Dam. The Colorado River Aqueduct’s 242 miles of siphons, pumps
						and canals would extend 242 miles from Lake Havasu in Arizona to Los Angeles; eighty miles of canals would bring water from the Imperial Dam to the
						Imperial Valley. The canals and aqueduct would cross state lines and irk some Mexicans downstream.
					</p>
					<p>
					The Hoover Dam became something the Bureau of Reclamation and Congress could be proud of. Curved and massive, the concrete	<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/arch-gravity%20dam"> arch-gravity</a> dam would soar more than 700 feet into the air, catapulting into
						record books. The dam squats mightily downstream of Lake Mead, a reservoir deep enough to capture 28.5 million acre-feet — 9.2 million gallons, or
						<a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/wisconsin-uses-over-2-trillion-gallons-of-water-a-year-4q8p3fb-192763861.html">
							four times what Wisconsin uses annually.
						</a>
					Today, the dam’s	<a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/faqs/powerfaq.html">19 generators produce enough energy to power 1.75 million average American homes</a>.
						Hoover’s hydropower also could fund its construction; with the last generator’s installation, it became the most powerful hydropower facility in the world.
					Building the dam <a>cost $49 million and more than 100 deaths throughout </a>construction.
					</p>
					<p>
						While the main pretense of the dam was to protect against floods, the reservoir would provide the two things that make societies flourish: power and
						dependable water.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Water is the critical thing lacking to have a wonderful life,” <em>Dead Pool</em> author Powell adds. “If you put yourself in the mindset of the people in
						the ‘20s and ‘30s I mean, we’d all build Hoover Dam if we could.”
					</p>
					<p>
						A boon to the New Deal agenda, dam building employed hundreds of jobless young men. Dams later provided electricity critical in developing military
						vehicles, artillery and the like.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the end, the benefits of dams compounded by a drive to subvert the river’s power for electricity or other uses made damming the Colorado River an
						obvious choice to residents and legislators. But prospects of big dams made basin state officials worry about future access to the river, leading the way
						for a series of heated negotiations.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>Dividing the Spoils</h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						While measures were being put in place to give California its canals, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling that upended traditional western water use and
						solidified the importance of getting to western resources first.
					</p>
					<p>
						Traditionally, anyone who owned land on a river could use the water flowing through it, a notion known as riparian (or “river bank”) law. However, the
						court’s <a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/100628936/13EDC9567CA34F6F913/3?accountid=14244">1922 ruling in Wyoming v. Colorado</a> replaced that
						doctrine with a new view on water use known as <a href="http://www.cobar.org/tcl/tcl_articles.cfm?articleid=4063">prior appropriation</a>, briefly defined
						as “first in time, first in right.” No matter who owned land along a riverbank, the first people ever to have used the water had first dibs annually. That
						change established a premise for water use still observed throughout the basin today.
					</p>
					<p><span class="pullQuote">“At that time, conservation meant holding water in reservoirs for use during dry periods, which is a bit different than how we think of conservation now.”
					<span class="pullQuoteAuthor">-Vern King</span></span>
					Prior appropriation “has everything to do with the mess that we're in today,” says <em>National <a>Geographic</a></em> author Jonathan Waterman. “In fact, whenever you get a good idea for
						conservation, you then have to address the prior appropriations doctrine and figure out ways around it.”
					</p>
					<p>
					The ruling worried officials in the six other basin states. California	<a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/159464612/13EDC92C5F26B1ECDC/5?accountid=14244"></a> had used the river first decades before, and its thirsty
						population wanted to fund the pricey waterworks. With a head start of being “first in right,” California could drain the river before other states claimed
						their share.
					</p>
					<p>
						Representatives from the seven states crammed into a Santa Fe lodge in 1922, hoping to set up a system for sharing the river before Congress approved the
					dam and channels. Then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover led the commission that came out with the	<a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/pdfiles/crcompct.pdf">Colorado River Compact</a>, the first part of a doctrine known as the Law of The River,
						just in time.
					</p>
					<p>
					“In hindsight, it’s easy to see	<a href="http://blogs.umb.edu/buildingtheworld/energy/hoover-dam-and-colorado-river-compact-united-states/">lots of drawbacks</a> depending on what your
					value set is,” King says of the Compact. “I think they did a good job, but t	<a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/104228274/13EDC95B81D34F6F913/1?accountid=14244">here wasn’t a consensus.</a> There was political horse
						trading, both in Congress and within the states, and acknowledgement that there would be impacts.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Apart from dividing river water, the commissioners decided how the water should be used. The Compact’s first article lists proper uses, or beneficial uses
						of the water, for industry, home use, energy and above all agriculture. A goal of protecting the river wasn’t considered.
					</p>
					<p>
						“At that time, conservation meant holding water in reservoirs for use during dry periods, which is a bit different than how we think of conservation now,”
						King says.
					</p>
					<p>
						The states couldn’t agree on how to divide the water by states, even after six years of negotiations, so Hoover and commissioner Delph Carpenter scrapped
						determining distributions to individual states. Instead, they decided to split
						the states into an Upper and Lower Basin, divided at Lee’s Ferry, Ariz. Each basin would get slightly less than half the river’s annual, leaving buffer
						room in case of drought, or if Mexico wanted in on the deal.
					</p>
					<p>
					“(The) proposal thus solved one problem only to create another” by delaying state appropriations, Powell writes in <em>Dead <a>Pool</a></em>, “but it did allow the commissioners to show that they had accomplished
						something.”
					</p>
					<p><span class="pullQuote">“Most people think that everything pertaining to a state begins and ends at the boundary of a state, but California commands an enormous amount of power."
					<span class="pullQuoteAuthor">-Mark Fiege</span></span>
						Each basin was given 7.5 million acre-feet of water, about a quarter of what Lake Mead could hold, and what the commissioners believed to be slightly less
						than half of one year’s average annual flow, leaving a buffer in the event of drought. The Lower Basin — including California — had primary water rights.
						However, the data they used were incomplete. The commission expected 18.5 million acre-feet to be available each year, overestimating by about 3.5 million
						acre-feet. The commission had only 20 years of thorough stream flow records, and it would be decades before they found out that those were the wettest
					years the basin had seen in centuries. <a href="http://www.climas.arizona.edu/files/climas/images/feature-articles/feb2009_fig2.gif">The supposed buffer was entirely imaginary</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to assuming that water flows had been normal for the prior few decades, the commissioners made another assumption when the Compact was ratified
						as part of the <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/pao/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf">Boulder Canyon Project Act</a> in 1928. In the Act, Congress approved $165
						million for construction of the dam at Boulder Canyon and the All-American Canal to the Imperial Valley; put the Secretary of the Interior in charge of the
						Lower Basin; and then divided how much water would go to the Lower Basin states when the states’ representatives couldn’t decide how to do it themselves.
						The Californian majority gained the most and more than any other state. More than that, Californians won the right to use any water the other states failed
						to use, setting Californians up for decades of feeling like they had more water than they really did.
					</p>
					<p>
						More resources put canal-backing California in a position to maintain its population growth and political power, professor Fiege says.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Most people think that everything pertaining to a state begins and ends at the boundary of a state,” he says, “but California commands an enormous amount
						of power.”
					</p>
					<p>
					Despite giving California special consideration, the commissioners went ahead	<a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/150304517/13EDC92C5F26B1ECDC/13?accountid=14244">without Arizona’s consent</a> in their haste to agree,
						precipitating three decades of infighting.
					</p>
					<p>
						Consideration for key players — Mexicans and Native Americans — was minimal. Should Mexico ever want water, the commissioners wrote, the supplies would
						have to come from surplus. The river’s health was never explicitly considered.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, distribution of populations throughout the Southwest is quite different than in 1928, and the Compact’s flaws have become apparent. Water
						administrators, such as King, find themselves considering the Compact with a lawyer’s meticulousness to provide for their constituents.
					</p>
					<p>
						“We kind of have adjusted the interpretation, not adjusted the Compact,” King says. “The first rule of the Law of The River is whatever the seven basin
						states and the federal government can agree to can probably be worked into the Compact.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Some people would like to scrap the system all together and start fresh, King says, but doing so would be reckless. Agreements like the Compact have a lot
						riding on them.
					</p>
					<p>
						With something “that impacts this many people, that has infrastructure built upon it, you just can’t go in and change things overnight,” he says.
						“Otherwise, you’d end up with some pretty drastic consequences.
					</p>
					<p>
						“To change water use, you’d have to get new losers to get new winners,” he says. “It’s a finite resource. Somebody has to lose their water.”

					<h4>In a bind</h4>
					<p>John Wesley Powell was stuck. In search of pitch from Pinyon Pines to caulk what was left of the Colorado River Exploring Expedition boats, Powell now found himself braced halfway up a chimney of rock, thousands of feet above the Colorado River and his men recuperating in the camp below. He couldn’t down-climb without risking a deadly fall to the narrow ledge he had started from, and the chimney began to widen above him. Finding himself unable to go up or down, he went sideways, further into the crevice he was wedged in. Here, he was able to rest enough to keep climbing, topping out to the rare sight of a sky un-confined by canyon walls. </p>
					
					<p>It was at this point that Major Powell realized his mistake. Although he’d brought a barometer with him that had admittedly made “climbing hard,” he had nothing with which to gather the tree sap. “QUOTE ABOUT SLEEVE.” </p>

					<p>Had it only been eight years since he had enlisted in the Union Army? A son of immigrants, Powell was simultaneously driven by his childhood interest in natural history and a nationalistic pride in the country developing before his eyes. Lincoln was a personal hero of his, yet he was reluctant to experience the front and hoped to be assigned as a fortifications engineer. He found himself in a more active post, leading an artillery brigade, when a lead Minnie ball at the battle of Shiloh struck his right arm above the wrist as he raised it to signal the artillery men he commanded. Remembering the destruction later, he wrote “I scarcely noticed until I attempted to mount my horse.” Powell was tossed 20,000 men died that day. It was the bloodiest battle of the Civil War up to that point. </p>

					<h4>Geological Time</h4>
					<p>After making barometric measurements critical to mapping the course of the river, the point of the whole expedition in the first place, Powell noticed a storm rising on the horizon. In the desert, storms were quick, destructive and powered large events called geologists call “mass wasting”. Arid desert soils are don’t soak up rains and the water masses and mobs down the landscape, when it encounters a canyon, the water’s velocity and force overwhelm the upper walls. Boulder studded debris screams down the cliffs, revealing new landscapes in its path. What Powell witnessed on his way down the cliffs was a small incident in the life of a canyon, but a life threatening force of nature to the lives of the nine men who had accompanied him on his self-funded expedition. As he hurried down the cliffs to warn them, Powell knew that two forces shape a canyon, and both depend on the interplay between rock and water. </p>

					<p>At a time where many people believed the earth was thousands of years old, geology attracted people who contemplated and wondered at the staggering amount of time that held the capacity to carve out landscapes, witness the origin and extinction of species and ossify unknown life forms in ancient muds. And the American Southwest was a perfect place to see the scale of geological time splayed out before them. </p>

					<p>Canyons are scars of the battle between the water and the rising Colorado Plateau. The actual rocks that the Colorado slices through are about half as old as the earth itself, the oldest being about 2 billion years old. However, the river Powell likens to a saw slicing through the layers is much younger, about 2 million years old. What makes the Colorado so powerful is the sediment load it carries constantly sandblasts its own channel, grain by grain cutting itself deeper into its bed. The loss of elevation determines how fast that laden water moves. The Colorado cuts through the Colorado Plateau, which simultaneously experiences uplift while the ancient scattered tributaries assembled into the river we now know. As the plateau gradually rose, the eastern side went slightly higher, and year-by-year its waterways gained speed, liquid running off a table that was being tilted.</p>

					<p>The barometric readings Powell took at the top of the cliffs were scientifically critical to determining their elevation relative to sea level, but were meaningful to his crew of mountain men veterans and buckskin ramblers below because it might provide a scanty clue of what to expect.</p>

					<p>Throughout the expedition, the element that plagued the men the most was the unknown. Being the first, meant they would never know what was around the next bend. It could be uninterrupted swift-moving calm waters that could carry them 40 miles in a day, or it could be the clean thin line and distant roar which would be their introduction to a waterfall and sure destruction. The men depended on the fact that they would be able to beach above rapids and “line” the boats down bad rapids. But they knew they couldn’t depend on that through the whole trip. Knowing their elevation and their distance left to travel, they could estimate if they were gradually losing elevation or if they would be left with hundreds of feet to somehow descend in the last stretches. When they had set off, they truly only knew one thing, if disaster struck, there were few chances for escape. </p>

					<p>Later down the river, far away from Cataract Canyon, Powell was in another bind. This one kept him up in the middle of the night with a decision. He was charismatic and decisive, but Powell had trouble as a leader. Powell took his dinners apart from the other men, insisted on taking scientific measurements despite dwindling food stores, and had never quite forgiven Oromel Howland for losing records and maps in a rapid months earlier. All of these things contributed to the bad blood the group faced almost three months into the trip. The barometers were all long busted and the remaining nine men were down to their last few pounds of wormy flour. The crew was camped above what one member recorded in his journal as emphatically the worst rapid they had seen yet, the sight of which compelled three members of the crew, brothers Oramel and Seneca Howland and Andrew Dunn, to decide to chance the cliffs and the desert beyond rather than follow Powell down the river. That night, Powell lay awake with the roar of the next days’ rapids in his head agonizing. At three in the morning, he woke Oramel Howland and tried to convince him to change his mind. The adversity they’d been through: the near drownings, the campfires, the fights, the horrible food, the trust that had withstood all that had somehow evaporated. Oramel refused. Neither side would follow the other into what they thought was sure death.</p>

					<p>With tears streaming down bearded faces, the two factions parted. The three wouldn’t take their part of the rations with them, so one from the boats placed some precious food where they would find it on their way out of the canyon. Powell and the boats miraculously made it through the rapids and a day later, startled a Mormon homesteader on the mouth of the Virgin River. The Powell expedition had made it down the Colorado River. The three men were never seen alive again. There is still controversy, but the leading theory for what happened to them is that they were killed, shot by Shivwit indians after a miscommunication. </p>

					<h4>What made Powell so unique?</h4> 

					<p>It is strange that a few years after his men were murdered that Powell would make the effort to live with the very tribe that had reportedly killed them. This was in an era where it was unusual for white people to approach native people’s at all. But as Powell Historian Mark Law explains, “that was just part of his genius.” Since childhood Native Americans, their history and their alien ways of life had fascinated him. It was his fascination with the area and his dedication to the burgeoning field of natural science that he went to the West year after year. Powell would make a career out of contributing to the study of the West and its native people. His time with the native people would contribute significantly to his later ideas on the capacity of the Western lands he helped chart. </p>

					<p>After the continental wars of the mid-century, it was a national interest to encourage people to populate it, both as a national security issue – to strengthen a tenuous claim by working the land AND to produce goods in service of the national economy. Powell agreed with the impulse to encourage settlement in the West, but differed from his contemporaries’ spurious claims, hyperbolic suggestions, and in accurate science in attempts to do so. </p>

					<p>What made Powell different from those like ____ Gilpin, who claimed that “QUOTE” or _______________ who claimed that rain would “follow the plow” and make tilling desert soils fruitful?</p>

					<p>Joseph Powell, Powell’s father, was an itinerant Methodist preacher whose frequent absences meant ‘Wes’ often managed the farm and his other siblings. He knew and respected the hard work that went into farming. He had seen the Civil War and knew about the consequences of quarrelling between states over resources. Most of all, Powell was a self-described naturalist. In the depths of his canyon expeditions he regularly risked his life and remaining limbs in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. This inoculated him against fevered hyperbole. The result was respect for the potential in provable facts and testable hypotheses. After spending time with Native American Tribes like the Shivwit, Southern Ute and Hopi, Powell fundamentally understood that water was the major limiting factor in developing the West. Importantly, Powell didn’t argue with progress; in his Arid Lands report to congress after his second expedition down the Colorado River, he offered pragmatic ways to use the land that were born of his experiential understanding of the land he had, in part gained through the generations of his Native American teachers.  In his report, Powell laid out his ideas that the Government should take a hand in social engineering in the West by granting people large tracts of land on which they would be encouraged to form small communities and herd or graze cows or sheep. This community would subsistence farm with the help of a small dams or diversion on tributaries of the Colorado. His ideas emphasized the importance of watersheds in political negotiations, and foresaw squabbling over water that flowed crosses state borders.</p>

					<h4>“All Used Up”</h4>
					<p>The tribes who had influenced Powell had predecessors. Named in the O’odham language to mean “all used up,” we will probably never know what a massive pre-historic North American civilization called itself. We do know the Hohokam were extensive, about 60-80,000 people at it’s peak, supported by an estimated 110,000 acres. They worked the land around central Arizona for more than ten centuries before scientists believe their reliance on the Salt River made them vulnerable to an extended drought and their civilization collapsed around 1450 A.D. </p>

					<p>The canals were complicated feats of engineering. Canals require complex math, it’s not so much just a way to carry water from the river to the field, but they must do so gradually. The Hohokam knew that too much gradient and the moving water would dig out the channel, too slow and the water would get backlogged. The physics of moving water also demanded the canal systems be entirely calculated before construction. You could not just extend the canal after water entered the system, as the rest of the system had been planned for a set amount of water to flow through its channels and fields. To add on to a passive canal system like the Hohokam’s would be like adding an extra limb to a living body. The Hohokam’s canals lose about 1-2 feet per mile of canal, a feat that is hard to accomplish even with today’s modern equipment. </p>

					<p>Not only are there engineering implications to the Hohokam irrigation projects, but there are obvious socio-economic implications too. Dr. Jerry Howard, an expert on the Hohokam looks at modern societies using irrigation to arrive at commonalities that may have been true for the Hohokam. “Irrigators always squabble,” he says in reference to one of his findings. “Quote with more explanation.”</p>

					<p>Almost four hundred years later, in 1867, two years before Powell’s expedition, Jack Swilling noticed fertile soils along the Salt River. He saw an opportunity for growth and formed the Jack Swilling Irrigation Canal Company. He and others excavated an ancient canal and began raising crops in the Valley of the Sun. As more people joined the settlement, Swilling, a Confederate veteran, suggested naming it Stonewall, after the general. They went with Phoenix, as their town was rising from the ashes of an ancient civilization. In 1880 their population was 2,453; in 1920 it was 20,000. </p>

					<p>Literally built on the ruins of a civilization that failed because of its reliance on the Salt River, a tributary of the Colorado, Phoenix is the exact opposite of Powell’s ideas on how to develop the West. But what could have been done? Once the groove of settlement is scratched into benevolent land, it is hard to reverse it. It’s human nature for people adhere to these small outposts and use their ingenuity to improve the opportunities they find. People, like water, start across a landscape following the path of lease resistance around obstacles. Once established, halting development of a city like Phoenix is like trying to stop a river.  

					<p>Change is inevitable, it happens in large earth shattering events, like the mass wasting Powell saw hurtling down the cliffs, or the Colorado River Compact, ratified in 1928 which ignored Powell’s advice and became the scaffolding for more than a century of water exploitation and grandiose engineering projects on the Colorado. But change also happens incrementally, grain by grain, person by person. </p>

					<h2>DAMAGES</h2>
					<h3>By Natalie Taylor</h3>
					<h4>A FISH TALE</h4>
					<p>
						Tucked away in scrapbooks in northern Mexico, photographs from the 1930s show astonished men hugging fish as big as themselves. The fish, which can weigh
						more than 300 pounds, are called totoaba. They live exclusively in a 300-mile wide zone in the upper Gulf of California, in waters between the Baja
						Peninsula and mainland Mexico.
					</p>
					<p>
						The totoaba is an unusual fish. Its mouth is on the underside of its head, and its disproportionately small eyes give the fish the appearance of permanent
						dismay, as though you have just taken its glasses. A member of the drum family, it uses special muscles to strike an organ called a swim bladder, making a
						drumming sound. Most fish use swim bladders for buoyancy; this species of drum uses it as an instrument.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every spring for millions of years, the totoaba converged on the Colorado River delta. At that time of year, the river was laden with the minerals, silt
						and nutrients that ran off an area of land about the size of France. By the time
						the river passed the delta to reach the Gulf of California, it had become a soup, its contents a critical part of countless food chains. There, the organic
						matter from the river nourished the totoaba fry and protected them from predators in the darkness caused by the plume of sediment the river washed into the
						sea.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, as U.S. politicians negotiated and signed agreements and laborers banked and diverted water upstream, the totoaba
						headed toward extinction. They continued to spawn in the delta, where <em>in flagrante</em> fishermen easily hauled in the fish. Their swim bladders were
						(and still are) an ingredient in a Chinese soup called <a href="http://www.biol.wwu.edu/trent/alles/TheDelta.pdf">Seen Kow</a>, considered a delicacy.
						Fishermen fed their families on the money from the dried bladders rather than the meat of the giant fish itself.
					</p>
					<p>
					A market for the meat developed in the U.S., and sport fishermen started vacationing at the Gulf of California.<a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/fish/totoaba.htm">In 1942</a>, fishermen	<a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/fish/totoaba.htm"> caught</a> 2,000 metric tons of totoaba, in 1958, only 300 and by 1975, only 58 tons. After
						that, the Mexican government completely banned totoaba fishing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feeding the U.S. market for meat and the Chinese market for delicacies was not the only reason the population was decimated. The totoaba was caught in the
						crosshairs of overfishing and habitat destruction. Upstream diversions such as the Hoover Dam disrupted the river’s pulse since the 1930s, and water
						consumption kept the Colorado River from regularly reaching the sea since the 1960s, cutting off the ingredients so essential to the fish’s reproduction
						and growth.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, totoaba are critically endangered. Their plight represents the far-reaching impact dams and other water diversions along the Colorado River have had
						on wildlife. For the totoaba, the obvious villains are poachers who ignore the totoaba’s endangered status and dry the organs on their garage floors before
					smuggling them into the U.S. where they can sell them for hundreds of dollars each. The less obvious culprit is the lack of freshwater. But hope for the delta flickers in a
						recent agreement between the U.S. and Mexico to release more water downstream. To begin to understand why the Colorado no longer reaches the ocean requires
						a look upstream to Lake Mead which as of this writing holds only half its capacity.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>Ordering Water</h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						Bruce Williams thinks of the reservoir he manages as half-full. He is the TITLE HERE at Hoover Dam that retains the water of Lake Mead and is an optimist
						in the face of projected differences between the river’s supply and human’s water demands. In controlling the water flow out of Hoover Dam and to the Lower
						Basin states, Williams acknowledges that in some respects, he has the economy of the Southwest at his fingertips. “I feel like Superman,” he says of his
						position.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each year, the seven states of the Colorado River basin, as well as X Native American nations and Mexico, are allocated a certain amount of water under the
						Law of the River, a bundle of laws, contracts, compacts and amendments that long ago estimated how much water ran through the river and now dictates how
						much of that water states can take. Laws have been structured over the years so that certain users, such as the Imperial Valley in California, have rights
						to the water ahead of other users. Called “prior appropriation rights,” states upstream in the so-called Upper Basin can take their allotment but are
						beholden by the Law of the River to deliver the amount of water that downstream users have negotiated for themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Williams and his colleagues, who release the water, think of themselves as water wholesalers; others call them water accountants,. Either way, water is
						treated as a commodity, directed downstream from its reserves in Lake Mead. Williams notes that the Upper Basin has never failed to send water to the Lower
						Basin, despite a 14-year drought.
					</p>
					<p>
						When a user that has a contract, such as a city, places a water order, Williams documents the water’s release and subtracts that amount from that user’s
						allotment. That means double and triple checking a daily water log along with other tasks such as maintaining XX water gauges along the river. Williams
						also communicates with operators at a cascade of dams and diversions that stand in the way of that water order getting from Lake Mead to a sprinkler head
						above a field of carrots in the Imperial Valley, California.
					</p>
					<p>
						Williams, who has spent X years with the USBR, says he feels like the river’s caretaker. He answers to the man called the Watermaster, the Secretary of the
						Interior. Williams follows orders, makes sure the Law of the River is obeyed and releases water to downstream users. But no one orders water so the
						Colorado River can reach the sea.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>Life of the Delta</h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						“Everybody has a water right but the Colorado River itself, and that's ethically and fundamentally wrong,” says John Weisheit, passionate advocate and
						director for the non-profit Living Rivers.
					</p>
					<p>
					Whether they agree that a river has the right to reach the sea,	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/opinion/where-the-colorado-river-runs-dry.html?_r=0">other prominent voices</a> in support of the river blame an
						accident of geography—the fact that the Colorado crosses into Mexico before hitting the Gulf of California—for the failure of the river to join its delta
						completely.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Depletions have perhaps even more serious impacts on the river and its associated ecosystems as it travels its last few miles in Mexico,” writes Robert
						Adler in his book <em>Restoring Colorado River Ecosystem. </em>
					</p>
					<p>
						“If the Colorado River delta were completely within the boundaries of the U.S., we would consider it a disgrace that the river didn’t reach the sea,” says
						Karl Flessa, a paleoecologist at the University of XXXX. “The U.S. sort of doesn’t see it IT WHAT?. It almost doesn’t feel like one of their
						responsibilities.” SO HIS QUOTE IS CRITICAL OF MEXICO, right?
					</p>
					<p>
						No ecological surveys were conducted of the river before the dams began going up in the early to mid-1900s, and Flessa jokes that he is trying to
						reconstruct how the Colorado looked in the pre-DAMbrian era. If the river were flowing normally, the delta beaches would be constantly remade – eroded by
						the sea and renewed by the sediment washed down from the upstream canyons. This same sediment would nourish species like the totoaba,and manyothers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through the voice of Aldo Leopold in <a href="http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/Bonine/Leopold1949_GreenLagoons-150-158.pdf"><em>The Green Lagoons</em></a>
						, author Adler depicts how Leopold described a “verdant wall of mesquite and willow [that] separated the channel from the thorny desert beyond,” saying
						“when a troop of egrets settled on a far green willow, the look like a premature snowstorm.”
					</p>
					<p>
						At 2 million acres, the once-immense delta was a wetland habitat the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined, a crucial home for countless species of
						birds and other wildlife. The delta is now about 150,000 acres, 7.5 percent of what it used to be.
					</p>
					<p>
						Flessa describes the river sections of delta that still exist as a “green oasis of willow and cottonwoods,” home to thousands of bird species. No longer
						bordered by the desert, the oases are instead surrounded by their agricultural successors: fields of alfalfa, wheat or onion,—economic endeavors irrigated
						by the river water.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, the delta beaches are almost exclusively made of masses of clam shells that attest to the fertility of the delta when the Colorado reached the gulf.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that the sediment is trapped behind the dams, the tides have washed the clams out of the sediment and accumulated them on the beach. “They crunch when
						you walk on them,” Flessa says. You may not be able to see the fish decline, but you can hear the crunch of what it means to millions of mollusks when the
						river stops.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ecologist Kirsten Rowell has other means of determining the extent of the damage to wildlife since the nutrient-rich river silt has been blocked from the
						delta. She uses otoliths, the ear bones of fish, to quantify what the Colorado River meant for the totoaba. A fish’s otolith looks like an iridescent,
						ridged contact lens. Concentric rings, like tree rings, reveal a fish’s age and hint about elements of its life. Comparing the otoliths she found in Native
						American middens (trash piles) from 5,000 years ago, Rowell has shown that the ancient totoaba grew twice as fast and matured two times earlier in the
						estuary of the Colorado River when it reached the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						“If the final reaches of this 6-million-year-old delta were in the United States, they would have been declared a national park, with a protected
					free-flowing river.,” wrote Jon Waterman in an	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/opinion/where-the-colorado-river-runs-dry.html?_r=1&amp;">op-ed in the New York Times</a> in 2012. “But because
						the river terminates in a foreign country, beyond the reach of the Endangered Species Act and most tourists’ cameras, it is suffering a slow death.”
					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>Minute 319</h4>
					</p>
					<p>
						While many have written about the dire situation in the delta, , hope in forestalling its death lies in recent negotiations between the U.S. and Mexico on
						the Law of the River.
					</p>
					<p>
						In December 2012, representatives from the U.S. and Mexico met in a hotel ballroom in San Diego to discuss and sign the most far-sighted amendments to the
						Law of the River seen yet.. It had taken years to get there.
					</p>
					<p>
						Amendments to the Law of the River are called Minutes. Minute 319 is an agreement between Mexico and the U.S. over water that ignores their borders and
						contains several revolutionary points. First, owing to an earthquake that destroyed much of its infrastructure in 2010, Mexico will now store its 1.5
					million acre-feet allocation in Lake Mead. Storing the water can help offset a water shortage declaration. As of this writing, the	<a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/hourly/rivops.html">current lake level</a> in Lake Mead was 47 percent of capacity and 31 feet away from a
					shortage being declared. Storing Mexico’s water allotment will raise the water level by	<a href="https://www.watereducation.org/userfiles/RiverReport_Winter13_web.pdf">15 feet</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Second, Mexico and the U.S. have agreed to share in any future water shortages. This decision is significant; in the event of water scarcity, the U.S.
						would give up some of its water to provide sufficient water for Mexico. In return, Mexico would be willing to accept less water than promised. The
						agreement is ground breaking because as opposed to the squabbling [LINK TO LANDGRAB] that characterized previous negotiations, Minute 319 emphasizes a
						sense of community around a single watershed.
					</p>
					<p>
						“This negotiated solution takes steps toward working that out with an <em>incredible</em> shift towards flexibility around that border. It is really ground
						breaking in that sense,” says Jennifer Pitt, who took part in the discussions on behalf of the Environmental Defense Fund, a large non-profit concerned
						with the delta.
					</p>
					<p>
						Perhaps the most revolutionary provision within Minute 319 sets aside 105,392 acre-feet of water solely for the environment, the first time an
						international treaty has set aside water for such benefit.
					</p>
					<p>
						In a one-time event, managers will release water to the river in 2014 to mimic a spring flood event. The release is expected to provide enough water for
						the Colorado River to flow over the delta ,and for the first time in 15 years, water from the Colorado River will reach the Gulf of California. Observers
						believe the release will benefit many species in unpredictable ways, and others hope that the local , Mexican economy will also flourish. Small businesses
						already established along the upper Gulf, fish camps and bird-watching tours are waiting.
					</p>
					<p>
						Minute 319 is set to expire in five years but it is a tentative step towards recognizing the value of a river reaching the ocean. It represents the power
						of negotiation and trust, observers say. After water managers at Lake Mead fill the order for the pulse flow to create the spring flood, scientists will
						closely study the pulse’s effect on the species that inhabit stretches of the river and upper delta. While they will not focus on the oceanic species, what
						they learn above the delta is intrinsically linked to the ocean-going species, including the totoaba,, in the Gulf of California.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like water manager Bruce Williams, paleoecologist Karl Flessa is also an optimist. He estimates that with consistent freshwater from the Colorado flowing
						into the sea, the shrimp population could increase in a couple of years, and in five years the numbers of catchable fish.
					</p>
					<p>
						Flessa expresses hope that populations of endangered species like the totoaba would bounce back. “I think there’s potential for that,” he says. “A little
						bit of water can have an enormous environmental benefit, and that environmental benefit can get translated into economic opportunities for people. We can’t
						quite turn the clock back, but the system as a whole is remarkably resilient.”
